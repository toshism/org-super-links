#+TITLE: org-super-links

*NOTE: The package prefix was changed from =sl-= to =org-super-links-=. You will need to update any configuration or keybindings you have made!* This is already on =develop= branch and will be part of the =0.4= release.

Create links with auto backlinks is the general idea.

I'm trying to keep this as flexible as possible. There are a few different ways to use this to support different use cases and workflows. See [[#usage][Usage]] for a more detailed explanation. There are also a few tips and useful functions on the [[https://github.com/toshism/org-super-links/wiki/Tips][wiki tips page]].

I also want to keep this as close to pure org-mode as possible. No external db, no functions required for reading, etc. It should function as just a regular org-mode file. This makes it much more usable for me on my phone. Using [[https://beorgapp.com/][beorg]] or [[https://organice.200ok.ch/][organice]] for example. It also allows the links to function as normal for exporting and things like that. It's just pure org.

I'm still kind of fleshing out the idea, but I think I like it.

* Installation

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-super-links
    :bind (("C-c s s" . org-super-links-link)
	   ("C-c s l" . org-super-links-store-link)
	   ("C-c s C-l" . org-super-links-insert-link)))
#+end_src

* Usage

The idea is to keep this as simple as possible and not enforce any particular system or workflow, but to be flexible enough to support many. It's a simple concept, when you insert a link, insert a backlink at the target.

There are a few different ways you can use this to integrate into your preferred workflow.

*** Org link replacement

Use it just like you would use regular org links. Instead of calling =org-store-link= call =org-super-links-store-link=. Then to insert the link instead of =org-insert-link= call =org-super-links-insert-link=. That will insert a link as normal while also adding a backlink at the target of the link. This should work the same as regular org links, with the benefit of adding the backlink.

*** org-super-links-link

To create a link at point call =org-super-links-link=. That will bring up the configured search interface (=helm-org-ql= by default) and allow you to select the target. Once selected a link will be inserted at point, and a backlink added to target.

*** helm-org-ql/helm-org-rifle action

There is also a =helm-org-ql= and =helm-org-rifle= action. To use this method, with the point at the place you would like the link, call =helm-org-ql= / =helm-org-rifle=. Select the target of the link and from the actions menu choose =Super Link=. A link pointing to the selected candidate will be created at point, and a backlink will be added to the target.

*** capture template

Whenever =org-capture= is called a link to the current point is automatically stored. To insert this link simply call =org-super-links-insert-link=. The backlink will be created automatically as usual.

*** org-super-links-quick-insert-inline-link

Creates a link ignoring the =org-super-links-related-into-drawer= and =org-super-links-link-prefix= settings and inserts a link with no prefix at point.

*** org-super-links-quick-insert-drawer-link

The inverse of =org-super-links-quick-insert-inline-link=. Insert a link ignoring the =org-super-links-related-into-drawer= and =org-super-links-link-prefix= settings. Inserts a link using =org-super-links-link-prefix-timestamp= for the prefix and either =org-super-links-related-into-drawer= or =org-super-links-related-drawer-default-name= for the drawer name. =org-super-links-related-into-drawer= has precedence if it's set to a string.

*** org-super-links-delete-link

Delete the link at point, and the corresponding reverse link.
If no reverse link exists, just delete link at point.
This works from either side, and deletes both sides of a link.

*** org-super-links-convert-link-to-super

Convert a normal org-mode link at `point' to super link.  If
=org-super-links-related-into-drawer= is non-nil move the link into drawer.

When called interactively with a =C-u= prefix argument ignore
=org-super-links-related-into-drawer= configuration and do not modify existing
link. Only add the backlink.

* Configuration

The variables below allow quite a bit of flexibility to allow you to fit =org-super-links= into your workflow. None of these are required. My personal config is [[#my-personal-setup-and-configuration][here]]

*** org-super-links-backlink-into-drawer

   Controls how/where to insert the backlinks.
   If non-nil a drawer will be created and backlinks inserted there.  The
   default is BACKLINKS.  If this is set to a string a drawer will be
   created using that string.  For example LINKS.  If nil backlinks will
   just be inserted under the heading.

   Default: =t=

*** org-super-links-backlink-prefix

   Prefix to insert before the backlink.

   This can be a string, nil, or a function that takes no arguments
   and returns a string.

   Default is the function =org-super-links-backlink-prefix-timestamp= which returns
   an inactive timestamp formatted according to the variable
   =org-time-stamp-formats= and a separator ` <- `.

*** org-super-links-backlink-postfix

   Postfix to insert after the backlink.
   This can be a string, nil, or a function that takes no arguments and
   returns a string

   Default =nil=

*** org-super-links-related-into-drawer

   Controls how/where to insert links.
   If non-nil a drawer will be created and links inserted there.  The
   default is =org-super-links-related-drawer-default-name=.  If this is set to a
   string a drawer will be created using that string.  For example LINKS.
   If nil links will just be inserted at point.

   Default: =nil=

*** org-super-links-related-drawer-default-name

   Default name to use for link drawer if =org-super-links-related-into-drawer= is
   =t=.  See [[#org-super-links-related-into-drawer][org-super-links-related-into-drawer]] for more info. This is also used
   when calling =org-super-links-quick-insert-drawer-link= if
   =org-super-links-related-into-drawer= is =nil=.

   Default: =RELATED=

*** org-super-links-link-prefix

   Prefix to insert before the link.
   This can be a string, =nil=, or a function that takes no arguments and
   returns a string

   Default =nil=

*** org-super-links-link-postfix nil

   Postfix to insert after the link.
   This can be a string, =nil=, or a function that takes no arguments and
   returns a string

   Default =nil=

*** org-super-links-default-description-formatter
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       ba63c582-56ba-4772-94f6-8319f1b33ff0
   :END:

   What to use if no description is provided.
   This can be a string, =nil= or a function that accepts two arguments
   LINK and DESC and returns a string.

   =nil= will return the default desciption or the link.
   string will be used only as a default fall back if set.
   function will be called for every link.

   Default is the variable =org-make-link-desciption-function=.

*** org-super-links-search-function

   The interface to use for finding target links.
   This can be a string with one of the values 'helm-org-ql',
   'helm-org-rifle', or a function.  If you provide a custom
   function it will be called with the `point` at the location the link
   should be inserted.  The only other requirement is that it should call
   the function =org-super-links--insert-link= with the =buffer= and =pos= of the
   target link.  AKA the place you want the backlink.

   Using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][helm-org-ql]] or [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-rifle][helm-org-rifle]] will also add a new action to
   the respective action menu.

   See the functions =org-super-links-get-location= (in the =org-super-links.el= file) or =org-super-links-org-ql-link-search-interface= (in =org-super-links-org-ql.el=) for examples.

   Default is set based on currently installed packages. In order of priortity:
   1. "helm-org-ql"
   2. "helm-org-rifle"
   3. =org-super-links-get-location=

   =org-super-links-get-location= internally uses =org-refile-get-location=.

* Tips

These are just a few tips on things you can do that may be interesting or helpful.

*** org-id

When creating links it's generally better to use an =id=. Add this to your config file so that any headings you link to or from get an id added automatically. I would strongly recomend using this.

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org-id)
(setq org-id-link-to-org-use-id 'create-if-interactive-and-no-custom-id)
#+end_src

*** quick "related" link

OUTDATED: I've added two functions to replace these. =org-super-links-quick-insert-drawer-link= and =org-super-links-quick-insert-inline-link=. I'll leave these here in case someone may still be interested for some reason.

Often when I'm writing I just want to quickly add a link to another heading that may be related. I found it's convenient to use something like this.

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun org-super-links-quick-related ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((org-super-links-link-prefix "\nrelated: "))
      (org-super-links-link)))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s r") 'org-super-links-quick-related)
#+end_src

Since =org-super-links= automatically stores the current heading any time you call =org-capture=. I use this one a lot to just quickly insert a link in the capture template without necessarily wanting to explain the context before I start writing.

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun org-super-links-quick-insert-related ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((org-super-links-link-prefix "\nrelated: "))
      (org-super-links-insert-link)))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s i") 'org-super-links-quick-insert-related)
#+end_src

These quick related links make me think I should possibly add the option to log links into a drawer too. I find myself wanting to do this reasonably often. If anybody else feels the same I'll probably add that option.

*** limit length of link description

Sometimes heading titles can get a bit long. You can define a custom function to limit their length and set =org-super-links-default-description-formatter=. Here's a very naive way to keep them short. This will blidly truncate all link descriptions to a maximum of 20 characters. You could come up with a more sophisticated function for limiting the length by words or something.

#+begin_src elisp
  (defun org-super-links-truncate-description (link desc)
    (truncate-string-to-width desc 20))

  (setq org-super-links-default-description-formatter 'org-super-links-truncate-description)
#+end_src

The default value of =org-super-links-default-description-formatter= is set to =org-make-link-description= so you can also set that to apply the changes to all org-mode links globally.

*** Index headlines

I've found it's useful to create "index headlines" to make navigating notes convenient. For example I have a hiearchy of locations I use for location specific notes such as restaurant recomendations or vacation planning. These often end up being just a heading with a bunch of backlinks from various notes.

#+begin_src

     etc...

 #+end_src

I do a similar thing for any topic I find myself creating a lot of notes for but that I may not want to be under the same heading, or if I want it under multiple headings.

This combination of tags and index headings makes it easy to find things.

*** My personal setup and configuration

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-super-links
  :quelpa (org-super-links :repo "toshism/org-super-links" :fetcher github :commit "develop")
  :bind (("C-c s s" . org-super-links-link)
         ("C-c s l" . org-super-links-store-link)
         ("C-c s C-l" . org-super-links-insert-link)
         ("C-c s d" . org-super-links-quick-insert-drawer-link)
         ("C-c s i" . org-super-links-quick-insert-inline-link)
         ("C-c s C-d" . org-super-links-delete-link))
  :config
  (setq org-super-links-related-into-drawer t
  	org-super-links-link-prefix 'org-super-links-link-prefix-timestamp))

#+end_src

Over time I've grown to prefer to just add links and backlinks both into drawers. I map =C-c s i= to =org-super-links-quick-insert-inline-link= for the rare occasion where I want a link inline. This ends up functioning sort of zettelkasten style.

*** drawer size

This is not specific to =org-super-links= but I like to set the face for drawers to be fairly small and the color close to the background. It helps keep things from looking cluttered when the drawers are collapsed.

I use something like this in my theme.
#+begin_src elisp
(org-drawer :foreground "#2F3841" :height 0.8)
#+end_src

That will make the drawer quite small when collapsed but the text inside full size when expanded.

*** org-export-with-broken-links

If you export subheadings from your org file that have links/backlinks you may want to set =org-export-with-broken-links= to =t=. Otherwise you may see an error like
#+begin_src
user-error: Unable to resolve link: "*Heading with a backlink"
#+end_src

See [[https://github.com/toshism/org-super-links/issues/22][issue #22]]

* Notes

This is still kind of in flux, so things could change... It's starting to settle down, but I'm still playing around with the idea a bit. If you want something that will stay reasonably stable pick a tag.
